# Analysis-of-COVID-19-Situation

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of May 4th 2020, over 3,500,000 cases have been confirmed in more than 120 countries and territories, with major outbreaks in United States and Europe.

Our project entails a thorough analysis over available data on COVID-19. Specifically, we conducted our data analysis over four questions of interest. They are

1. What is the infection trends of COVID-19 in the United States?

2. What might be the real patients number?

3. What is the best model to predict Number of Confirmed Cases?

4. What factors are playing crucial roles in determining whether a country is more likely to have a massive outbreak?

5. What insights can we obtain from the previous pandemic in better preparing global solutions for COVID-19?

Our data mainly come from Kaggle and WHO. The significance and related interest of such projects go without saying as millions of people’s well-being are under threat. A generalization of what we did in terms of modeling includes utilizing SIR model to simulate disease developing trend, featuring SVM model to predict total infection numbers and interactively visualizing infection map using plotly. We also combined logistic regression method with above models under multiple parameter tuning effort.
